Solarized Modern PuTTY Defaults
===============================

A Windows registry (.reg) file for setting the "Default Settings" PuTTY profile to [Solarized Dark PuTTY coloring](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) and most [modern sane PuTTY default settings](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/putty-configuration/) that most would want.

Usage TL;DR
===========
1. Download the .reg file, review it in an editor, then double-click it.
2. Make new PuTTY profiles (they inherit the "Default Settings" profile)

Usage Detailed
==============
1. Read "What You Get" below to ensure this is what you want to set for your "Default Settings" profile in PuTTY.
2. (OPTIONAL, most modern Linux distros have this): Test your intended destination systems for the putty-256color terminal definition by running ```infocmp putty-256color```. If you don't see a bunch of crazy terminal definition stuff spit to your screen, you don't have the putty-256color terminfo data. Figure out why and fix it if you care to continue.
2. Download the .reg file based on whether you want Dark or Light (review it in a text editor for your own security conscience)
3. Double-click on it to set the settings in the Windows registry, then use PuTTY to change anything you don't like.
4. Make new host-specific PuTTY profiles from within PuTTY (they will inherit your Default Settings).
5. If you get stuck in any way, go read the blog posts from Tom and Dag in the "Thanks" section of this README.
